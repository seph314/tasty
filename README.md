### School project - Tasy Recipes
This is a recipe site called Tasy Recipes. It has a backend created with PHP, and a fronend created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is built with the MVVM architecture, the serverside has a Model, View and Controller and the frontend has a ViewModel that handles the commentsection and then mirror the information to the server. I ran this project on a local apache server with a MySQL database.
